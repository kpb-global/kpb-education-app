/// (`android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`) both declare `kpb`, but nothing
/// consumed the resulting URLs — so `xcrun simctl openurl booted kpb://…` only
/// foregrounded the app without navigating. This service subscribes to
/// [AppLinks.uriLinkStream] — which delivers both the launch URL (replayed to
/// its first listener) and every link received while running — and routes each
/// through [AppRoutes.normalizeExternalRoute], the same untrusted-input gate
/// used by push notifications and quick actions. Anything that does not resolve
/// to a registered route is ignored, never navigated.
///
/// supabase_flutter already runs its own [AppLinks] listener for OAuth
/// redirects (`io.supabase.kpbeducation://…`); the two coexist because each
/// filters for its own scheme (a supabase URI resolves to null here).
